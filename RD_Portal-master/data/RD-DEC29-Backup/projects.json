Numerical values, Biopsy, Ultrasound are the various data sources for thyroid malignancy. Ultrasound is one of the standards imaging technology for diagnosis. To make the better prediction the proposed study adopts the extended machine learning techniques Deep Neural Network. Traditional preoperative diagnosis process includes both ultrasound check and fine needle aspiration. The malignancy report will be further confirmed by the surgical and pathological process. However, the proper diagnosis is considered to be the most challengeable task for the clinicians. In the recent subfield of machine learning, deep learning has been applied in most of the computer-aided diagnosis for better accuracy. The biological images are pre-processed and subjected to Training (70 % of data) and Testing (30 % of data). The proposed classifier is a kind of supervised classification based on deep neural network and convolution neural network which is trained by the ultrasound images with the benign or malignant label of pathology. The proposed system presents the most viable solutions to big data analysis in terms of efficiency and scalability The proposed model helps to minimize Medication prescription errors, adverse drug events and other medical errors further, the proposed model will be compared with the traditional random forest, support vector machine and neural networks for better results. The study will support the female students particularly those with PH to understand their improper lifestyle and thereby provide solution.","createdAt":{"$date":"2020-09-15T04:55:59.75Z"},"history":[{"approvedby":"ADMINID","_id":{"$oid":"5f604f13b75844454a7abcb0"},"commitMessage":"keyword update","userId":"ADMINID","updatedDate":{"$date":"2020-09-15T05:20:19.694Z"}},{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"5f6049c0b75844454a7abca0"},"updatedDate":{"$date":"2020-09-15T04:57:36.762Z"},"commitMessage":"Keywords","userId":"19CSESVV"},{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"5f604960b75844454a7abc9f"},"updatedDate":{"$date":"2020-09-15T04:55:59.75Z"},"commitMessage":"Project created","userId":"19CSESVV"}],"projectContent":[],"projectupdate":[],"updatedAt":{"$date":"2020-09-15T05:21:17.813Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f604a1fb75844454a7abca3"},"edited":{"summaryedit":false,"keywordedit":true,"detailedit":false},"remarks":{"summaryRemarks":"","keywordsRemarks":"","detailsRemarks":"","referenceRemarks":""},"team":["09CSEJD","06CSEKCR"],"projectDepartment":["CSE"],"projectLab":["cser3"],"views":0,"status":"02","referenceLink":[],"keywords":["e learning","MOODLE","teacher-student interaction","knowledge building"],"approved":true,"visibility":true,"review":true,"start":"2015-02-14","end":"2020-09-15T05:22:17.723Z","projectId":"PRO100004","projectTitle":"Interactive endeavour to enhance learning","projectSummary":"Recent technologies provide wide opportunities for learning at remote places and enables people collaboration anywhere.

Cross linked polyethylene (XLPE) has been used for power cables since the early sixties, because of their outstanding electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. The quality of both the insulation and the semiconducting screen materials has been continuously improved with respect to production processes, contamination level, additives and so on. However, failure of cables due to electrical treeing phenomenon is still considered as a major problem when cables are aged due to both internal and external factors. Electrical treeing starts in the defective (or) weak portion of cable insulation due to enhanced localized electric field stress, which slowly builds up and finally bridges the high voltage conducting core with the ground. Throughout the world, great efforts have therefore been put into the development of new, improved insulation materials, aiming at the ultimate goal of developing an electric tree resistant material. \n\tNano composites are emerging as an innovative insulating material for challenging applications in all types of electrical equipment used in the power systems.

If not preserved properly they are subject to physical damage and decay. Some of the most deterioration agents are climatic factors like variations in relative humidity and temperature, light, insects, constant handling and adverse storage. Our forefathers went on inscribing on palm - leaves with their stylus until their hands ached. They copied old texts to be preserved for posterity. This tradition lasted until perhaps the time of our fathers. People of our generation have thrown these precious manuscripts into the river without making copies of them. A computer based printed reproduction of classical Tamil text from palm leaf manuscripts is proposed based on image processing techniques. Image processing techniques such as statistical and transform based approach can be used on the monochrome images of palm leaves for classifying different characters present on the palm leaves. The developed semi-automatic system would be capable of retrieving handwritten text into printable text.","createdAt":{"$date":"2021-04-12T06:15:37.948Z"},"history":[{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"609225f5603bef0b849c5f7c"},"commitMessage":"Contributor update","userId":"02ECERSS","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-05-05T04:58:29.28Z"}},{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"6073e5cf4b85740857a8d8c0"},"commitMessage":"Completed project","userId":"02ECERSS","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-04-12T06:16:47.136Z"}},{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"6073e5bb4b85740857a8d8bf"},"commitMessage":"Project created","userId":"02ECERSS","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-04-12T06:15:37.948Z"}}],"projectContent":[],"updatedAt":{"$date":"2021-05-05T04:58:29.279Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"6073ed3f4b85740857a8d8c2"},"edited":{"summaryedit":false,"keywordedit":false,"detailedit":false,"refedit":false},"remarks":{"summaryRemarks":"","keywordsRemarks":"","detailsRemarks":"","referenceRemarks":""},"team":["04ITPIR"],"projectDepartment":["IT"],"projectLab":["itr3"],"views":0,"status":"01","referenceLink":[],"keywords":[],"approved":true,"visibility":true,"isarchived":false,"review":false,"start":"2019-03-22","end":"","islocked":false,"projectId":"PRO100067","projectTitle":"AICTE - SKILL AND PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME CENTRE FOR SC/ST STUDENTS\n","projectSummary":"The broad objectives of the Centre shall be to provide opportunity to SC/ST students in the Institutes to reorient themselves in the light of emerging employment opportunities in Engineering undergraduate/Diploma students at all level.

Ice accumulation can result in performance problems and safety concerns for transmission lines, marine and offshore structures, refrigeration, cryogenics, wind turbines, and heat exchangers. Wetting properties are important for ice formation on surfaces from the liquid phase, where the water repellency of the surfaces could enhance their anti-icing effect. Such surfaces will be prepared by using a nanotextured coating. A thermal evaporation system will be proposed for nanocoating on a copper surface. The prepared surface produces a contact angle of 162°±2°. The Low Bond Asymmetric Drop Shape analysis is used to measure the contact angle using imageJ software. The heat transfer performance of an evaporator is affected by frost formation. In this work, the heat transfer coefficient of the surface will be estimated in the defrosting process.  The effect of hydrophobicity and superhydrophobicity of surfaces, surface inclination, surface chemistry, morphology, and roughness scale will be studied on the defrosting process. In particular, wetting characteristics of the superhydrophobic surfaces revealed defrosting performance. The experiments will be performed in controlled environmental conditions. The anti-icing properties of superhydrophobic surfaces with different topography but similar chemistry are studied.","createdAt":{"$date":"2021-04-19T09:44:07.646Z"},"history":[{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"607d50e04b85740857a8d93b"},"commitMessage":"Project created","userId":"10MECDSK","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-04-19T09:44:07.646Z"}}],"projectContent":[],"updatedAt":{"$date":"2021-04-19T09:44:07.646Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"607ea7534b85740857a8d944"},"edited":{"summaryedit":false,"keywordedit":false,"detailedit":false,"refedit":false},"remarks":{"summaryRemarks":"","keywordsRemarks":"","detailsRemarks":"","referenceRemarks":""},"team":["06ECEKRK"],"projectDepartment":["ECE"],"projectLab":["ecer3"],"views":0,"status":"01","referenceLink":[],"keywords":[],"approved":true,"visibility":true,"isarchived":false,"review":false,"start":"2020-06-20","end":"2022-06-20","islocked":false,"projectId":"PRO100070","projectTitle":"AICTE MODROBS(RURAL)","projectSummary":"Modernization of Digital Signal Processing laboratory to Farm field Signal Sensing and Processing laboratory","createdAt":{"$date":"2021-04-20T10:01:40.498Z"},"history":[{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"607ea7534b85740857a8d945"},"commitMessage":"Project created","userId":"06ECEKRK","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-04-20T10:01:40.498Z"}}],"projectContent":[],"updatedAt":{"$date":"2021-04-20T10:01:40.498Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"607eb10d4b85740857a8d94a"},"edited":{"summaryedit":false,"keywordedit":false,"detailedit":false,"refedit":false},"remarks":{"summaryRemarks":"","keywordsRemarks":"","detailsRemarks":"","referenceRemarks":""},"team":["08ITSVI"],"projectDepartment":["ECE"],"projectLab":["ecer3"],"views":0,"status":"01","referenceLink":[],"keywords":[],"approved":true,"visibility":true,"isarchived":false,"review":false,"start":"2020-06-09","end":"2022-06-09","islocked":false,"projectId":"PRO100071","projectTitle":"AICTE MODROBS","projectSummary":"Modernization of DSP lab to Farm field Signal sensing and processing laboratory","createdAt":{"$date":"2021-04-20T10:46:37.406Z"},"history":[{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"607eb10d4b85740857a8d94b"},"commitMessage":"Project created","userId":"08ITSVI","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-04-20T10:46:37.406Z"}}],"projectContent":[],"updatedAt":{"$date":"2021-04-20T10:46:37.406Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"607eb10d4b85740857a8d94c"},"edited":{"summaryedit":false,"keywordedit":false,"detailedit":false,"refedit":false},"remarks":{"summaryRemarks":"","keywordsRemarks":"","detailsRemarks":"","referenceRemarks":""},"team":["08ITSVI"],"projectDepartment":["ECE"],"projectLab":["ecer3"],"views":0,"status":"01","referenceLink":[],"keywords":[],"approved":true,"visibility":true,"isarchived":false,"review":false,"start":"2020-06-09","end":"","islocked":false,"projectId":"PRO100072","projectTitle":"AICTE MODROBS","projectSummary":"Modernization of DSP lab to Farm field Signal sensing and processing laboratory","createdAt":{"$date":"2021-04-20T10:46:37.475Z"},"history":[{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"607eb1dc4b85740857a8d94f"},"commitMessage":"Added files","userId":"08ITSVI","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-04-20T10:50:04.756Z"}},{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"607eb10d4b85740857a8d94d"},"commitMessage":"Project created","userId":"08ITSVI","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-04-20T10:46:37.475Z"}}],"projectContent":[],"updatedAt":{"$date":"2021-04-20T10:50:04.756Z"},"__v":0,"documents":{"filledApplication":{"path":"./FileSystem//Project/PRO100072/File","fileName":"modrobs-1618915783178.pdf"}}},{"_id":{"$oid":"607fbf5d4b85740857a8d957"},"edited":{"summaryedit":false,"keywordedit":false,"detailedit":false,"refedit":false},"remarks":{"summaryRemarks":"","keywordsRemarks":"","detailsRemarks":"","referenceRemarks":""},"team":["08TXTDRA","08TTKMI"],"projectDepartment":["FT"],"projectLab":["ftr1"],"views":0,"status":"01","referenceLink":[],"keywords":[],"approved":true,"visibility":true,"isarchived":false,"review":false,"start":"2016-01-04","end":"2018-01-03","islocked":false,"projectId":"PRO100073","projectTitle":"Modification of Industrial Grade Sewing Machine for Differently Abled persons","projectSummary":"The project received from DST under Instrumentation Development Programme.

This is one of the worst periods in history. Almost all countries were under lockdown. It\nhas shaken us and our economy almost all big giants like United States, China and the European Union are under\neconomic meltdown. This pandemic has shaken up both the human race and the economies of all the countries.\nFrom past few months, what we have seen that is inconceivable. From the economic point of view, a major concern\nis the future of the textile industry. The textile and clothing industry employs over 105 million people and earns\naround USD40 billion in forex, aside from substantial revenue under GST and other taxes.\nDomestically, there would be very less consumption has been expected till February 2021. Big brands and small\nretails all of them are halted their production and buying raw material as well as cut the buying budgets to prepare\nthem for any shortfalls during this year. Banarasi saree manufacturers are in less in demand during this pandemic\nas same as other fabrics. But, Post Covid-19, would be in the high demand to fulfill due to ceremonies are on halt\nand expected to have a load of ceremony start in near future.\nIn general the women’s status is measured in terms of their level of education, employment, income and their roles\nand responsibilities in the family and society. At the same time the status of tribal women is in very low level, we\nmust accept that fact. The basic reason behind this low level is lack of education and empowerment. Without money\nand education, many tribal works as labors in industries, households and construction. Despite exploitation by\ncontractors and managers, tribal are more sincere and honest thannon-tribal. Their condition remains unchanged\neven during the modern times with only few changes. In India, women ever had given any right of liberty and\nequality. In addition to above China has banned the export of 1500 tons Silk and would increase the danger in the\nfuture after couple of months.\nThis project aims to empower the tribal women through sericulture. Sericulture is an important agro based cottage\nindustries. It has a great potentiality to generate employment opportunities on a massive sale in rural section. India\nhas been ranked as the second major and largest silk production in the world. The target of this project is to develop\nthe empowerment of tribal women through sericulture activities at Yercaud in Salem district in Tamil Nadu.\n","createdAt":{"$date":"2021-04-24T08:31:12.668Z"},"history":[{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"6083d8be4b85740857a8da1d"},"commitMessage":"Submitted in DST which is under review","userId":"10CSESAT","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-04-24T08:37:18.084Z"}},{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"6083d8704b85740857a8da1a"},"commitMessage":"Project created","userId":"10CSESAT","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-04-24T08:31:12.668Z"}}],"projectContent":[],"updatedAt":{"$date":"2021-04-24T08:37:18.084Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"6083db1e4b85740857a8da34"},"edited":{"summaryedit":false,"keywordedit":false,"detailedit":false,"refedit":false},"remarks":{"summaryRemarks":"","keywordsRemarks":"","detailsRemarks":"","referenceRemarks":""},"team":["10CSESAT"],"projectDepartment":["CSE"],"projectLab":["cser1"],"views":0,"status":"01","referenceLink":[],"keywords":[],"approved":true,"visibility":true,"isarchived":false,"review":false,"start":"2021-12-20","end":"","islocked":false,"projectId":"PRO100087","projectTitle":"FDP ONMACHINE LEARNING TOOLS FOR RESEARCH PROBLEM SOLVING UNDER AICTE ATAL SCHEME","projectSummary":"Machine Learning (ML) is a major step forward in how computer system adapts, evolves and learns.

Nursing a disabled person is a challenging task, as a nurse has to understand each and every patient mindset and also have to clean the patient feces in order to maintain a healthy environment around the patient. One of the reasons for this high rate of accidents is the lack of nursing personnel. In order to aid caregivers while nursing elderly patients who are not able to move about freely. The proposed project aims at design and develops a smart bed enabled with latest technologies such as IoT and AI. This arrangement would enable the patient to obtain a timely attention from nurses/caregivers. This would keep them comfortable as well as prevent them falling accidentally and also fasten their recovery period.","createdAt":{"$date":"2021-04-24T09:47:19.96Z"},"history":[{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"6083e9da4b85740857a8dab8"},"commitMessage":"Implementation part is on going","userId":"19CSERPD","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-04-24T09:50:18.562Z"}},{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"6083e6aa4b85740857a8daa0"},"commitMessage":"Ongoing implementation","userId":"19CSERPD","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-04-24T09:36:42.986Z"}},{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"6083e6964b85740857a8da9f"},"commitMessage":"Project created","userId":"19CSERPD","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-04-24T09:47:19.96Z"}}],"projectContent":[],"updatedAt":{"$date":"2021-04-24T09:50:18.562Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"6083e7a54b85740857a8daa3"},"edited":{"summaryedit":false,"keywordedit":false,"detailedit":false,"refedit":false},"remarks":{"summaryRemarks":"","keywordsRemarks":"","detailsRemarks":"","referenceRemarks":""},"team":["08CSEPRJ","08CSENAN","06ITSSL","06CSESAE","06CSEKCR","08CSEKAL"],"projectDepartment":["CSE"],"projectLab":["cser1"],"views":0,"status":"02","referenceLink":[],"keywords":["crew monitoring, southern railways"],"approved":true,"visibility":true,"isarchived":false,"review":false,"start":"2017-11-11","end":"2021-04-24T09:41:36.139Z","islocked":false,"projectId":"PRO100103","projectTitle":"Web App and Mobile App development for Railway Crew Management ","projectSummary":"design and develop mobile and web application for crew monitoring system for southern railways, salem.","createdAt":{"$date":"2021-04-24T09:40:33.647Z"},"history":[{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"6083e7e34b85740857a8daa5"},"commitMessage":"This project was completed.

A hearing aid mobile application (APP) is developed using matlab and deployed in android hardware. .  The smart mobile microphone is used to collect the voice. The execution of APP gives the 4 adjustable sliding bars. Volume adjustment slider is used to vary the input value volume from 1 to 25. The filter adjustment slider is used to reduce the noise present in the signal. The center frequency slider is used to assign the specific voice level. The gain adjustment slider is used to vary the sensing level. The android hardware microphone input is multiplied using the constant value set in the master volume slider. The preprocessing includes ADC conversion and level adjustments. The noise filter eliminates the unwanted signal due to high gain settings. The balanced equalizer reads the input from center frequency and gain. The filtered signal is converted into hearable voice based on center frequency and gain level. The output is available in android speaker.","createdAt":{"$date":"2021-05-05T09:22:50.864Z"},"history":[{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"60926433603bef0b849c5f85"},"commitMessage":"The development of APP was completed.","userId":"07ECEBTN","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-05-05T09:24:03.565Z"}},{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"609263ee603bef0b849c5f84"},"commitMessage":"Project created","userId":"07ECEBTN","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-05-05T09:22:50.864Z"}}],"projectContent":[],"updatedAt":{"$date":"2021-05-05T09:24:03.564Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"60926551603bef0b849c5f87"},"edited":{"summaryedit":false,"keywordedit":false,"detailedit":false,"refedit":false},"remarks":{"summaryRemarks":"","keywordsRemarks":"","detailsRemarks":"","referenceRemarks":""},"team":["07ECEBTN"],"projectDepartment":["ECE"],"projectLab":["ecer3"],"views":0,"status":"02","referenceLink":[],"keywords":[],"approved":true,"visibility":true,"isarchived":false,"review":false,"start":"2020-07-15","end":"2021-05-05T09:30:13.927Z","islocked":false,"projectId":"PRO100114","projectTitle":"IOT based security wake up system","projectSummary":"The security wake up system generates the alarm and multicolor reflected lighting.

This has major disadvantage like consuming more silver during plating due to long exposure of anklets to the electrodes and electrolytes. Instead a new technology, pulse plating is introduced for plating of silver anklet  using electro deposition method. In pulse plating, the DC power arrives in the bath in a series of short pulses. These pulse cycles can be regulated at predetermined rates to over 10,000 times per second.  Precise changes in the regulation of these cycles provide different results to the plated deposits, depending on the metal being plated. Typical advantages of pulse plating include better distribution, lower porosity, higher density, greater throwing power, improved hardness and less metal usage.","createdAt":{"$date":"2021-05-06T11:17:23.062Z"},"history":[{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"6093d1db603bef0b849c5f9c"},"commitMessage":"COMPLETED","userId":"06ECEKRK","updatedDate":{"$date":"2021-05-06T11:24:11.744Z"}},{"approvedby":"","_id":{"$oid":"6093d119603bef0b849c5f9a"},"commitMessage":"Project

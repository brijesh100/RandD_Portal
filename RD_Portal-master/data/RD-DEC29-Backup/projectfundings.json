Unfortunately, vast amount of water is wasted due to various reasons. One among the major reasons being drippling of water from taps. With the increased, water scarcity problem it is very much essential to look on the inefficient wastage of water at various points. , The lack of adequate and integrated water management and poor water allocation is the main focus of this project. Currently, in India, water management system has been widely used for agriculture, industry and institutions.\n\nThe existing water management system takes more time to collect the data, which provides little information about the data. A proper decision on steps to control the water wastage cannot be taken up using the obtained data. In order to avoid the issues, the smart water management system is proposed to analyze the data and make the decision in a short time and at low cost. It performs the operations which includes identifying the leakages of the water and real-time monitoring of water levels in overhead tanks.","keywords":["Smart water management

Educators who work with individuals who are deafblind have a unique challenge to ensure a meaningful communication. Every individual in this group may have varied range of understanding level and response time. Therefore, the teacher should allow time for the student to respond. The major form of  communication includes: Touch cues, Object symbols, Fingerspelling, Braille etc. Hence there is a need to design and develop a cost effective teaching assistive device cum application for the Blind Deaf children.  This approach enables the children’s who are deafblind to learn and communicate with normal  people. It also generates a Braille output for the given text information and vice versa.","seedmoney":true,"keywords":[],"fundingAmount":{"applied":null,"received":null,"consumable":null,"nonConsumable":null},"isUserApplied":true,"fundDates":{"applied":"2020-12-15","received":"2021-04-16","start":"2021-04-16","end":"2021-12-31"},"applicationChecks":null,"status":"08","approved":false,"visibility":true,"isarchived":false,"Department":["CSE"],"Remarks":"","fundingProjectId":"FUP100015","nameOfGrant":"Student

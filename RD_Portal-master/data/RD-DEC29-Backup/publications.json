The data generated in many real-world applications like data form IoT environments and big data domains are heterogeneous in nature. Most of the available clustering algorithms deal with data in homogeneous nature, and there are few algorithms discussed in the literature to deal the data with numeric and categorical nature. Applying the clustering algorithm used by homogenous data to the heterogeneous data leads to information loss. This chapter proposes a new genetically-modified k-medoid clustering algorithm (GMODKMD) which takes fused distance matrix as input that adopts from applying individual distance measures for each attribute based on its characteristics. The GMODKMD is a modified algorithm where Davies Boudlin index is applied in the iteration phase. The proposed algorithm is compared with existing techniques based on accuracy. The experimental result shows that the modified algorithm with fused distance matrix outperforms the existing clustering technique.","coAuthor":["98CSEJAK"],"publicationId":"PUB100007","publicationType":"Book Chapter","publicationName":"IGI Global","paperTitle":"Genetically-Modified K-Medoid Clustering Algorithm for Heterogeneous Data Set","volumeNumber":null,"ISSN":"","pagesFrom":63,"pagesTo":76,"indexing":"Others","ISBN":"","yearOfPublication":{"$date":"2020-01-11T00:00:00Z"},"contributionAs":"First Author","issueNumber":null,"impactFactor":"","editionNumber":null,"DOIorURL":"10.4018/978-1-5225-9902-9.ch004","file":{"filledApplication":"","acknowledgement":""},"reach":"International","createdAt":{"$date":"2020-09-15T04:41:08.716Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2021-04-24T09:27:16.382Z"},"__v":0,"islocked":false,"extraCoAuthor":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f6046c1b75844454a7abc9b"},"publisherId":["09CSEJD"],"Remarks":"","approved":true,"Department":["CSE"],"abstract":"","coAuthor":[],"publicationId":"PUB100008","publicationType":"Conference Proceedings","publicationName":"IEEE","paperTitle":"A framework for interactive endeavor to enhance learning (iEEL)","volumeNumber":null,"ISSN":"","pagesFrom":198,"pagesTo":200,"indexing":"SCOPUS","ISBN":"978-1-4799-6876-3","yearOfPublication":{"$date":"2015-01-26T00:00:00Z"},"contributionAs":"Others","issueNumber":null,"impactFactor":"","editionNumber":null,"DOIorURL":"10.1109/MITE.2014.7020270","file":{"filledApplication":"","acknowledgement":""},"reach":"International","createdAt":{"$date":"2020-09-15T04:44:49.344Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2021-06-28T05:04:18.909Z"},"__v":0,"isarchived":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"5f60484cb75844454a7abc9c"},"publisherId":["19CSESAN"],"Remarks":"","approved":true,"Department":["CSE"],"abstract":"","coAuthor":["P.

Recently, a mobility management protocol called Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a Network based that has received much attention in Next generation IP mobile networks. PMIPv6 does not require a mobile node to participate in any of the mobility related signaling. During handover process in heterogeneous networks, a packet loss and handover latency problem occurred increasingly. However there are many existing methods to overcome these problems but still it’s a challenging task. The proposed work concentrate on PMIPv6 domain where the packet loss can be reduced by buffering scheme at MAG’s and the handover process is made rapidly by moving the data between two MAGs so that the latency will be reduced. Moreover the False Handover Initialization will be avoided by multicasting the data packets to both previous and new access devices where the out-of-packet sequence problem also reduced.\n\n","coAuthor":[],"publicationId":"PUB100059","publicationType":"Journal","publicationName":"International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science","paperTitle":"Optimizing handover

disease is a severe disorder in the nervous system due to the deposits of proteins like amino and tau causes demise in brain cells. It leads to many adverse effects in human body includes loss of memory, cerebral weakness. Foresee the Alzheimer’s disease has been researched widely in worldwide health organisations.It is a prolonged, irreparable sickness that causes loss of cerebral functioning. It slowly reduces and finally ends the reasoning ability, memory power, visualizing and grasping control. Alzheimer’s Association found that aging is the key threat and commonly the people of age 65 and above are highly affected by this disease. It is an intensifying disease that gets worse over the period and has no complete cure but temporary treatment can helps to lead the life if it is identified at the earlier stage. Estimating the depth of Alzheimer’s in its premature stage is a difficult task since it involved with lots of parameters. The objective of the proposed design is to bring a machine learning model that predicts Alzheimer’s disease precisely in its early stage by using classification algorithm called logistic regression and the output is displayed using web application. The proposed system can help the doctors or medical technicians to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease more accurately.

the present growing technology, the continuous monitoring of structures has been easier\ntask by using the various sensor techniques and Internet of Things technology to ensure the\nsafety and strength of the structures. All the structures will get degrade and deteriorate with\nincrease in time due to loadings, corrosion and other factors. To implement the continuous\nmonitoring system for the structures, the Sensors are plays major role for the monitoring\nprocess. Due to various continuous environment and climatic changes, the strength and\ndurability of the structures are severely affected and the damage deduction inside the concrete\nstructure is becomes a very monotonous process. The various non destructive testing methods\nwere used to find the strength, damage and durability assessment in the existing and proposed\nconcrete structures. In the destructive testing methods, the assessment is carried out near by\nthe concrete damaged structures by direct contact which may cause adverse effect. By using\nmodern technology, nowadays non destructive and non contact methods have been\nimplementing to deduct the various parameters of the concrete structures by using modern\nsensors. This review paper gives the overview about the sensors and explains the various\npractical applications of sensors in the concrete structures to identify the problems by using\nmodern sensors like piezoelectric sensor, Wireless sensor, and smart aggregate to deduct the\nconcrete strength, rate of corrosion, cracks, and strain deflection of the

the concepts and theories usually practiced in traditional manner. The concept of a subject can be visually expressed in terms of a new technology paradigm known as Augmented Reality (AR). Augmented reality is a method to construct or destruct any kind of visual or auditory information to or from the real world by augmenting the real-world environment. The virtual environment along with the real world can make the interactions better and help the students to learn better. For example, if the concept of neural network has to be explained, a chain of layers can be shown and the way the results travel to the next hidden layer can be elucidated at ease. By this, the students can learn the theories and concepts in a more practical manner and this will help them to learn better. This can be applied to all the subjects wherever the application of it can be outlined. The augmented environment is based on the three dimensions and hence it can convey the information in an efficient manner. The system can also react to the environment by detecting the gestures. If the entity is to be rotated or fragmented it can react and make changes accordingly. The Brain Computer Interface (BCI) integrated with augmented reality and virtual reality translates brain activity into commands to other devices in teaching the concepts and theories.","coAuthor":["11ITJDA"],"extraCoAuthor":[],"islocked":false,"publicationId":"PUB100413","publicationType":"Journal","publicationName":"International Journal of Advanced Science and

Generally diesel engines produce more pollutants than gasoline engines. In this research work, the emission behaviour of a single cylinder four stroke constant speed diesel engine fuelled with honge biodiesel blends are examined. The combustion chamber components are coated with Yttria Stabilized Zirconia material over bond coat with a total thickness of 200 μm approximately. The pollutants from diesel engine exhaust gases are measured and compared with standard engine. Drastic reduction in CO emission levels of about 20% for diesel and 29 % for B15 are recorded in coated engine than that of uncoated engine at full load. Unburnt HC and smoke emissions values are found less in coated engine of about 9% and 11% for diesel and B15. High in-cylinder temperature in coated engine increases combustion gas temperature which tends to increase NOx emission for biodiesel blends. B15 exhibits slightly higher NOx emission of 7.8% than other blends in coated engine. CO2 emission values remains higher for biodiesel blends in all loading conditions.","coAuthor":[],"extraCoAuthor":[],"islocked":false,"publicationId":"PUB100549","publicationType":"Journal","publicationName":"International Journal of Applied Environmental Sciences","paperTitle":"Influence of TBC Coating and Honge Biodiesel on Diesel Engine Exhaust Emission Control","volumeNumber":12,"ISSN":"0973-6077","pagesFrom":925,"pagesTo":935,"indexing":"SCOPUS","ISBN":"","yearOfPublication":{"$date":"2017-11-05T00:00:00Z"},"contributionAs":"Second Author","issueNumber":5,"impactFactor":"1.2","editionNumber":1,"DOIorURL":"http://www.ripublication.com/ijaes17/ijaesv12n5_17.pdf","file":{"filledApplication":"","acknowledgement":""},"reach":"International","createdAt":{"$date":"2021-04-21T09:40:58.834Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2021-04-21T09:44:43.325Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"607ff58b4b85740857a8d966"},"publisherId":["15MECSML"],"Remarks":"","approved":false,"visibility":true,"isarchived":false,"Department":["MECH"],"abstract":"In major countries across the world, automobiles are the major greatest polluter, as exhaust emissions from more than a billion transport vehicles on the road hold up to create problems.

paper presents a novel integrated statistical model to evaluate the diesel engine performance that is operating with duel fuel Jatropha and fish oil blend. Hence, a single cylinder, four stroke, direct Injection constant speed diesel engine was used. The experiments were taken from each category of the injection timing such as retardation, standard and advanced along with single proportion 100% biodiesel blend while other parameters’ injection pressure was maintained constant at 220 bar, respectively. The injection timing was changed during testing of the engine and the performance parameters were held for three different load conditions between 1, 50 and 100% at the rated power of 4.4 kW and a speed of 1500 rpm. From the experimental results, it was observed that BSFC tends to decrease from no load to full load. The maximum BTE for JF100 was found in retardation injection timing of 18° at full load. DEA a multi-response linear programming statistical optimisation tool was used to measure the performance and efficiency of a Biodiesel blend in the DI diesel engine. It was formulated by taking fuel blends relative performance efficiency in relation to input and output variables. Both Frontier and Ranking methods in DEA indicated nearly a good convergence with experimental

find the usefulness of computers in every field including medical\nfield. Scanning the affected part has become a standard study.\nDiagnosing a disease at the right time, i.e. early detection, from the\nstudy of images enables the physician to take right decision and provide\nproper treatment to the patient. With the alarming growth of\npopulation, it is difficult for every individual patient to get a second\nopinion from medical expert. In these situations, computer-aided\nautomatic diagnosis system will be much helpful. Diabetic retinopathy\nis a disorder that arises from increase in blood glucose level. Based on\nthe severity, it has been distinguished into four stages. Diagnosing\ndiabetic retinopathy at an early stage from retinal images and providing\nproper treatment will save the patient from severe vision loss. The\nproposed method adopts hybridized GLCM features and wavelet\nfeatures to classify the fundus images according to the severity of the\ndisease. The method is tested with fundus images collected from Indian\nDiabetic Retinopathy Dataset.","coAuthor":["02ECERSS","06ECEMEP"],"extraCoAuthor":["Dr.K.Manju
